Third-party cookies enable the integration of certain services from third-party companies within websites (e.g. cookies for processing payment services).</p> <p>Cookies have various functions.

If cookies are deactivated, the functionality of this website may be restricted.</p> <p>You can find out which cookies and services are used on this website in this privacy policy.</p>
 <h3>Inquiry by email, telephone or fax</h3> <p>If you contact us by email, telephone or fax, your inquiry including all resulting personal data (name, inquiry) will be stored and processed by us for the purpose of processing your request. We will not pass this data on without your consent.</p> <p>This data is processed on the basis of Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. b GDPR, provided that your request is related to the fulfillment of a contract or is necessary to carry out pre-contractual measures. In all other cases, the processing is based on our legitimate interest in the effective processing of the requests addressed to us (Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f GDPR) or on your consent (Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. a GDPR) if this was requested; Consent can be revoked at any time.</p> <p>The data you send to us via contact requests will remain with us until you ask us to delete it, revoke your consent to storage or the purpose for storing the data no longer applies (e.g. after your request has been processed). Mandatory legal provisions - in particular statutory retention periods - remain unaffected.</p>
 <h3>5. Plugins and tools</h3>
 <h3>YouTube with extended data protection</h3> <p>This website embeds videos from the YouTube website. The operator of the website is Google Ireland Limited ("Google"), Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland.</p> <p>When you visit one of these websites on which YouTube is integrated, a connection to the YouTube servers is established. The YouTube server is informed which of our pages you have visited. If you are logged into your YouTube account, you allow YouTube to assign your surfing behavior directly to your personal profile. You can prevent this by logging out of your YouTube account.</p> <p>We use YouTube in the extended data protection mode. According to YouTube, videos played in the extended data protection mode are not used to personalize surfing on YouTube. Ads played in the extended data protection mode are also not personalized. No cookies are set in the extended data protection mode. Instead, so-called local storage elements are stored in the user's browser, which, like cookies, contain personal data and can be used for recognition. Details on the extended data protection mode can be found here: <a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/171780" style="color: white; target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">support.google.com/youtube/answer</a>.</p> <p>After activating a YouTube video, further data processing operations may be triggered over which we have no influence.</p> <p>YouTube is used in the interest of an appealing presentation of our online offers. This represents a legitimate interest within the meaning of Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f GDPR. If a corresponding consent has been requested, the processing takes place exclusively on the basis of Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. a GDPR and § 25 Para. 1 TDDDG, insofar as the consent includes the storage of cookies or access to information in the user's terminal device (e.g. device fingerprinting) within the meaning of the TDDDG. The consent can be revoked at any time.</p> <p>Further information You can find out more about data protection at YouTube in their privacy policy at: <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=de" style="color: white; target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=de</a>.</p>

 <h3>Google Fonts</h3> <p>This site uses so-called Google Fonts, which are provided by Google, for the uniform display of fonts. When you visit a page, your browser loads the required fonts into your browser cache in order to display texts and fonts correctly.</p> <p>For this purpose, the browser you use must connect to Google's servers. This allows Google to know that this website was accessed via your IP address. The use of Google Fonts is based on Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f GDPR. The website operator has a legitimate interest in the uniform representation of the typeface on its website. If a corresponding consent has been requested, the processing takes place exclusively on the basis of Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. a GDPR and § 25 Para. 1 TDDDG, insofar as the consent includes the storage of cookies or access to information in the user's end device (e.g. device fingerprinting) within the meaning of the TDDDG. Consent can be revoked at any time.</p> <p>If your browser does not support Google Fonts, a standard font from your computer will be used.</p> <p>For more information about Google Fonts, see <a href="https://developers.google.com/fonts/faq" style="color: white; target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://developers.google.com/fonts/faq</a> and Google's privacy policy: <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=de" style="color: white; target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=de</a>.</p>
